Use the Yahoo Weather service to determine the current weather where you are,
and then ask the Cooper-Hewitt Museum's Collections API for an image that suits your weather.

This uses the <a href="http://simpleweatherjs.com/">Simple Weather</a> jQuery plugin by James Fleeting, and
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's <a href="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api">Collections API</a>.
